### Build summary for the contact section?

- Start with creating a slice and then store and reducers.
- Added a button to create new contact with a specific user id.
- And if we want to edit the contact then it will go the specific url with the contactId as it slug/param.
- And the same case for the delete to delete a perticular contact which have the id.

### Build process for the charts section?

- Start with the `react-query` for fetching the data and storing it.
- After that some modifiction according the chartjs's dataset.
- Try to use the `chartjs-plugin-zoom` (But failed miserably).

### Build process of the maps section?

- Same here use the `react-query` to fetch the data and then modifing it according to my need.
- Using a marker to show the data(covid stats of that country).
